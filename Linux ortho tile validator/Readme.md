# X-Plane Ortho Tile Validator

This bash script will check all "zOrtho4XP_" folders in a given parent folder for missing DDS textures.

**THIS SCRIPT IS TO BE CONSIDERED EXPERIMENTAL. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**  

&nbsp;

## Requirements

- Linux (could maybe also work on MacOS)

&nbsp;

## Usage

- Copy this to the folder where your ortho folders are in (most likely `X-Plane 11\Custom Scenery`)
- Run it from the terminal (navigate to your ortho folder first if necessary) with `./zScan_Orthos.sh`
- Scan results are saved as `zOrtho_tile_integrity.txt` in the folder that the script is located in.
